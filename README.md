# DPTP
Dynamic Parameter Testing Platform

Allows for the comprehensive testing of frequency and severity (as well as other problem and algorithm) paramters to ascertain MOEA performance across the possible dynamic instance space. Generation of distinct instances by combination of different frequency and severity parameters results in the construction of a dynamic instance space for a particular benchmark function. The recording of performance of MOEAs (and in future DMOEAs) enables the establishment of a baseline of expectable performance and allows for focusing of future experiments on challenging instances.
